# Backend Node
Building an API that requires you to fetch data from other API.
 
=> Here is what you will need to do to complete this task:
● For every tag specified in the tags parameter, fetch the posts with that tag using
the Hatchways API (make a separate API request for every tag specified).

 
=> The API response will be a list of all the blog posts that have at least one tag specified in the tags parameter.

=> The sortBy parameter specifies which field should be used to sort the returned
results. This is an optional parameter, with a default value of `id`.

=> The direction parameter specifies if the results should be returned in ascending
order (if the value is "asc") or descending order (if the value is "desc"). The default
value of the direction parameter is `asc`.


=> An important part of development is testing. In this step, we want to see tests written
for your routes. Do not use the solutions API route to perform testing in this step. Think
about the different ways to test the app, and the best way to get good coverage.
